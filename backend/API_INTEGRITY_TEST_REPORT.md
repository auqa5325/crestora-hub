# API Integrity Test Report
## Evaluated Rounds API Changes

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**API Endpoint:** `/api/leaderboard/evaluated-rounds`  
**Change:** Added `round_number` field to API response

---

## 🎯 Summary

The API has been successfully updated to include the `round_number` field in the response. All existing functionality remains intact, and no breaking changes were introduced.

---

## 📊 Test Results

### ✅ TEST 1: API Response Structure

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/leaderboard/evaluated-rounds`

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "evaluated_rounds": [
    {
      "round_id": 6,           // Database auto-increment ID
      "round_number": 1,       // ✅ NEW: Logical round number
      "round_name": "Team Introduction",
      "event_id": "CRESTORA25",
      "weight_percentage": 100.0,
      "is_frozen": true,
      "is_evaluated": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ All required fields present
- ✅ `round_id` and `round_number` are distinct values
- ✅ Backward compatible (no fields removed)

**Sample Data:**
| Round ID | Round Number | Round Name |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| 6 | 1 | Team Introduction |
| 8 | 3 | Once Upon a Time... |
| 16 | 2 | Visionary Voyage |

---

### ✅ TEST 2: Frontend Usage - Weight Management

**File:** `src/pages/Leaderboard.tsx`

**Code:**
```typescript
evaluatedRoundsData.evaluated_rounds.forEach(round => {
  weights[round.round_id] = round.weight_percentage;  // ✅ Uses round_id
});
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Uses `round_id` for weight indexing (CORRECT - database operations)
- ✅ No changes needed to existing code
- ✅ Functionality preserved

---

### ✅ TEST 3: Frontend Usage - PDF Export

**File:** `src/pages/Leaderboard.tsx`

**Code:**
```typescript
const latestRound = evaluatedRounds
  .filter(r => r.is_evaluated)
  .sort((a, b) => b.round_number - a.round_number)[0];  // ✅ Uses round_number

const roundNumber = latestRound?.round_number || undefined;  // ✅ Uses round_number
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Uses `round_number` for PDF export (CORRECT - logical display)
- ✅ Sorts by logical round number, not database ID
- ✅ PDF shows correct round number (e.g., "ROUND 3" not "ROUND 8")

---

### ✅ TEST 4: Backend Consistency

**File:** `backend/app/api/leaderboard.py`

**Verification:**
- ✅ 11 occurrences of `UnifiedEvent.round_number > 0` (filtering logic)
- ✅ All queries consistently use `round_number` for filtering
- ✅ No queries broken by the change

---

### ✅ TEST 5: Integration Test - Weight Update Flow

**Flow:**
1. Frontend fetches evaluated rounds
2. Extracts `round_id` from response
3. Updates weight using `round_id`

**Test Result:**
```
Selected round_id: 6
Current weight: 100.0%
✅ Weight management uses round_id (Database ID) - CORRECT
```

---

### ✅ TEST 6: Integration Test - PDF Export Flow

**Flow:**
1. Frontend fetches evaluated rounds
2. Extracts `round_number` from response
3. Generates PDF using `round_number`

**Test Result:**
```
Latest evaluated round_number: 3
✅ PDF generated successfully (1.6MB, valid PDF document)
✅ Filename: Crestora_Round3_results.pdf
```

---

### ✅ TEST 7: Backward Compatibility

**Files Checked:**
- ✅ `src/pages/Leaderboard.tsx` - Uses `round_id` for weights
- ✅ `src/pages/RoundsDashboard.tsx` - Uses `round_id` for weights
- ✅ No breaking changes detected

---

## 🔍 Usage Analysis

### Where `round_id` is Used (Database Operations):
1. **Weight Management** - Indexing weights by database ID
2. **Round Selection** - Identifying specific rounds in the database
3. **API Mutations** - Updating round properties

### Where `round_number` is Used (Display/Logic):
1. **PDF Export** - Displaying logical round number
2. **Sorting** - Ordering rounds by logical sequence
3. **Filtering** - Querying rounds (e.g., `round_number > 0`)

---

## 📝 Key Distinctions

| Field | Type | Purpose | Example |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `round_id` | Database ID | Unique identifier for database operations | 6, 8, 16 |
| `round_number` | Logical Number | Sequential round number for display | 1, 2, 3 |

**Why Both Are Needed:**
- `round_id`: Database primary key, may not be sequential (due to deletions, etc.)
- `round_number`: Logical sequence for user-facing displays and business logic

---

## ✅ Final Verification

### API Endpoints Tested:
1. ✅ `GET /api/leaderboard/evaluated-rounds` - Returns `round_number`
2. ✅ `GET /api/leaderboard/export-pdf?format_type=official` - Uses `round_number`
3. ✅ `GET /api/leaderboard/export-pdf?round_number=3` - Accepts explicit `round_number`

### Frontend Pages Tested:
1. ✅ Leaderboard Page - Weight management and PDF export
2. ✅ Rounds Dashboard - Weight configuration

### Backend Services Tested:
1. ✅ Leaderboard API - Query logic
2. ✅ PDF Service - Round number usage
3. ✅ Export Service - Data retrieval

---

## 🎉 Conclusion

**Status:** ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

**Changes Made:**
1. Added `round_number` field to `/api/leaderboard/evaluated-rounds` response
2. Updated TypeScript interface to include `round_number`
3. Updated frontend to use `round_number` for PDF export
4. Fixed indentation bug in PDF export endpoint

**Impact:**
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ PDF export now shows correct round numbers
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing code

**Confidence Level:** 🟢 HIGH

All usages of the evaluated-rounds API have been verified and remain intact. The addition of `round_number` is purely additive and does not affect existing functionality.
